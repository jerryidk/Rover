## Usage

```
make clean 
make flash  ---- Flash onto connected STM board 
make all    ---- Build
st-util     ---- Open gdb debugeer port
gdb:        ---- To debug
--- target remote localhost:<PORT> 
--- symbol-files  main.elf
```

## Work ethics

```
Master branch contains ready-to-go production code
Dev  branch contains development code. 

In order to ensure we always have a copy of working code, Master branch shouldn't be merged until dev branch is thoroughly tested. 
Normal work flow: 

- git pull origin                            ; sync yourself 
- git checkout dev                           ; go to developement
- write some code ...        
- git add and commit                         ; commit
- git checkout master                        ; Switch to master branch
- git merge dev and fix conflicts            ; Sync production (Make sure your code works !) 
- git push origin master                     ; Production! 

```

## Notes

### Remote USART

- [datasheet](https://www.etechnophiles.com/hc-05-pinout-specifications-datasheet/)
- [connection](https://askubuntu.com/questions/248817/how-to-i-connect-a-raw-serial-terminal-to-a-bluetooth-connection)

Schematic: Select datamode by pull EN low. Rest Pins are self explanatory. 
Commands to connect (pair the bluetooth first, password 0000 or 1234):
