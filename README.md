## Work ethics

```
Master branch contains ready-to-go production code
Dev  branch contains development code. 

In order to ensure we always have a copy of working code, Master branch shouldn't be merged until dev branch is thoroughly tested. 
Normal work flow: 

- git pull origin                            ; sync yourself 
- git checkout dev                           ; go to developement
- write some code ...        
- git add and commit                         ; commit
- git checkout master                        ; Switch to master branch
- git merge dev and fix conflicts            ; Sync production (Make sure your code works !) 
- git push origin master                     ; Production!
